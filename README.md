# Crypter

Similar to the Encrypter-Decrypter Java program, but written in Python.
This programs decrypts or encrypts a message using the following rules:

letter 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y', ... , 'z' becomes 'a'
punctuation and capitals are ignored.
Type or insert the string you want to encrypt or decrypt. Also compares the speed of doing so in two different ways. First method is converting each character to their corresponding ASCII equivalent and then reversing it, and converting it back to character. Second method is using if statement(given that there is no switch in Python) with all 26 lower case letters and switching it with an alphabeter in reverse order.
